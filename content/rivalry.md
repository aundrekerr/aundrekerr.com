When launching in Ontario, a full redesign of safety features was planned in order to make them more modular, easily accessible, and expandable across regions. Some of the features included: 
- Player self-exclusion 
- Player active time metrics
- Pathways to increased verification
- Player deposit/withdraw limits

*Rivalry's revamped Casino experience.*

Casino was an experience that allowed users to place wagers within browser games across many different vendors. The biggest challenge for this came in the development of supporting different integration and validation methods for the vendors of different games. 

In the second iteration, even more vendors were planned to be added along with a full interface revamp. Things were streamlined to accomodate hundreds of games from numerous vendors and also allowed much more customization for managers to serve experiences across different regions.

*"Same Game Combos" within the betting experience.*

Same Game Combos was a feature to promote chaining of bets within a single match. I was primarly implement it as a new type of bet within the betslip. The bet was visually striking compared to the normal navy/orange coloured bets and featured more interactions on the bet's singular match page. Progressively adding to the bet's "combo" length would cause it to animate a glowing brain more and more, while the bet interface itself was surrounded with "brain blast" (not my description) branding.
